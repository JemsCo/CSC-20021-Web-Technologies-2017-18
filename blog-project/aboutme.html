                    <p>
                        I am a Second year student at Keele University, studying Computer Science. I was born on the 9th of July 1997 and have lived
                        in a town called Bishops Stortford for most of my life. As a student I'm interested in pursuing a
                        career in Game Dev, ranging from design to modeling. I'm also interested in web development and cybersecurity
                        in the industry.

                    <p>One of my favouite quotes of all time is one by Douglas Adams which is shown below. It's just so bonkers
                        and silly yet so perfect in the context of the book (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).</p>

                        This is a web development project for CSC-20021 Module run by Goksel Misirli at Keele University. The site will grow each
                        week as we are given more and more tasks to complete throughout the semester's practicals. This project
                        will only be practice for the final peice that we have to hand in. The general Specification for
                        our coursework is build a personal website with a blogging platform. Pretty simple eh? Well hopefully
                        I can use the skills I learn from this project to apply them to the real thing.
